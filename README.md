<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />



<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022 Datacenter
- Windows 10 Pro (22H2)

<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Create Resource Group & Virtual Network
- Create Virtual Machines (Domain Controller & Client 1)
- Set Static IP for the Domain Controller
- Log in to Domain Controller via Remote Desktop and Disable Windows Firewall
- Configure Client-1 to Use DC-1 as its DNS server
- Verify Connectivity Between Client-1 and DC-1
- Install Active Directory Domain Services

<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

<p>
In the Azure portal, create a Resource Group named Active-Directory-Lab, and a Virtual Network called Active-Directory-VNet in the East 2 region. Going straight to Review + Create is fine for both steps.

</p>
<p>
Create the VM DC-1 using the Windows Server 2022 Datacenter image with at least 2 vCPUs. Set the administrator username to labuser and the password to Cyberlab123!. Ensure that DC-1 is connected to the Active-Directory-VNet. After Review + Create then Create.

</p>
<p>
Create the VM Client-1using the Windows 10 Pro image. Use the same credentials as for DC-1 and connect Client-1 to the Active-Directory-VNet. Then Review + Create, and Create.

</p>
<p>
Configure DC-1's network interface to use a static private IP address. You do this by going to network settings under networking of the dc-1 virtual machine. This step is crucial because the client will use this IP as its DNS server.

<p>
Remote into DC-1 using its Public IP via Remote Desktop. Log in using the credentials we set up above.
</p>
<br />

<p>
This is what the remote desktop session looks like on DC-1.

<p>
Right Click Start menu or the bottom left windows icon and click run. Type wf.msc for Windows Firewall.

</p>
<p>
In the Azure portal, navigate to DC-1 then Networking and copy the Domain Controllerâ€™s Private IP (in my case 10.0.0.4). Go to Client-1 > Networking and select its network interface configuration. Change the DNS Servers setting from Inherit from virtual network to Custom. Enter DC-1's Private IP as the DNS server and save the changes. Restart Client-1 to apply the new DNS settings.

</p>
<p>
Remote into Client-1 via its Public IP. Log in with the credentials above. You can select no for all the privacy settings and click accept.
<br />

</p>
<p>
Open Windows PowerShell as Administrator. Run ping 10.0.0.4 (or the actual static IP of DC-1) to test connectivity. Run ipconfig /all to confirm that the DNS server for Client-1 is set to DC-1's Private IP. After that you can close client-1 as we need to remote in DC-1 for the next step.
